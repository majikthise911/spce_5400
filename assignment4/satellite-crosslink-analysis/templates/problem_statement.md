In addition to SV downlink and uplinks in RF bands which we covered in SPCE 5085,  cross links (SV to SV) important to many space constellations.  There are important trade studies that need to be performed to decide whether cross-links should be designed around radio frequency (ie Ka band) or laser frequencies.  

Using lasers in space is attractive for its high data rates and low power requirements, but at the cost of high pointing accuracy among other technical challenges.  

Assignment:  Consider two small satellites in orbit at altitude 500 km, spaced in low earth orbit at a distance of 250 km apart.  The prescribed data rate between these SVs is 1 Gbit/sec. Now, perform a first order engineering trade to make a recommendation regarding the advantages vs. disadvantages of using laser cross links versus RF cross links at Ka band.  

The attached excel spreadsheet for laser links might be helpful as a template.  However, feel free to explore others.   You might modify this template and create another appropriate for general RF link for this comparison (Optical vs. RF (Ka)).  At a minimum, your trade should consider size of aperture, power, data rate, link margin and performance constraints (pointing accuracy).
