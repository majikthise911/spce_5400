problem statement:   Read assignment  1) Read Textbook Chapter 6 : Sun Synchronous [ read for comprehension, but no problem sets assigned on this chapter ]   2) Begin your project!   Read sections 1-3 of CubeSat 101 : Basic Concepts and Processes for first time Cubesat developers.  [ already uploaded to Background module ].   Now, consider a novel space mission [ or an extension of an existing mission ] that sparks your interest: commercial, research/exploratory, defense, etc.  Keep the scope reasonable.   Follow the CubeSat 101 process and create a first draft outline [ sections: Intro, Process, Mission Models] that would serve to describe the Cubesat [ as you'll see - there are many configurations possible] with sufficient detail that might attract funding.      If you have any preliminary ideas, that you'll like show me early on, please do!     ** this project will be worth 200 pts total.  The outline is the first increment, worth 50 pts, to augmented the remainder of the Cubesat 101 sections later.
