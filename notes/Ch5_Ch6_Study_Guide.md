# CHAPTER 5: LEO COVERAGE

## 🎯 Core Concept: What is LEO Coverage?

**Definition**: The fraction of Earth's surface from where users can see, access, and communicate with a satellite.

### Key Visualization

**Coverage** is the circular area on Earth from where the satellite can be seen:

![Coverage Geometry](../../study_guide_figures/01_coverage_geometry.png)

*This diagram shows the fundamental triangle relationship between the satellite, ground station, and Earth's center. Understanding this geometry is KEY to all coverage calculations!*

---

## 📐 5.1 Coverage Fundamentals

### Essential Terms (Memorize These!)

| Term | Definition | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Coverage Area** | Circular area on Earth where satellite is visible | Determines who can communicate |
| **Satellite Footprint** | Same as coverage area - the "shadow" of coverage | Visual way to think about coverage |
| **Elevation Angle (ε₀)** | Angle from horizon to satellite | Minimum angle needed for clear signal |
| **Ideal Horizon Plane** | Virtual flat surface ⊥ to Earth's radius vector | Theoretical maximum visibility |
| **Designed Horizon Plane** | Practical horizon with minimum elevation | Accounts for real-world obstacles |

### 🔑 Key Insight
**Each user within a satellite's coverage area has their own horizon plane** - this is why different users see the satellite at different angles!

---

## 🧮 5.2 Coverage Geometry & Mathematics

### The Coverage Triangle

The coverage triangle shows the geometric relationship between:
- **H** = Satellite altitude
- **RE** = Earth radius (6,371 km)
- **ε₀** = Elevation angle
- **α₀** = Nadir angle
- **β₀** = Central angle
- **d** = Slant range (distance to satellite)

See the detailed diagram above for the complete geometric visualization!

### 📊 Master Formula Set

**Triangle Relationship:**
$$(\varepsilon_0 + 90) + \alpha_0 + \beta_0 = 180°$$
*(Equation 5.1)*

**Simplified:**
$$\varepsilon_0 + \alpha_0 + \beta_0 = 90°$$
*(Equation 5.2)*

**Sine Law Application:**
$$\frac{\sin\alpha_0}{R_E} = \frac{\sin(90 + \varepsilon_0)}{R_E + H}$$
*(Equation 5.3)*

**Nadir Angle Formula:**
$$\sin\alpha_0 = \frac{R_E}{R_E + H}\cos\varepsilon_0$$
*(Equation 5.4)*

**Maximum Nadir Angle** (at ε₀ = 0°):
$$\alpha_{0,max} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{R_E}{R_E + H}\right)$$
*(Equation 5.5)*

### 🎯 THE COVERAGE FORMULA

**Coverage as percentage of Earth's surface:**
$$C[\%] = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \cos\beta_0)$$
*(Equation 5.7)*

Where:
- $SAT_{COVERAGE} = 2\pi R_E^2(1-\cos\beta_0)$
- $S_{EARTH} = 4\pi R_E^2$

---

## 💡 Active Recall Question #1
*Before looking at the answer below, try to answer:*

**Q: Why is LEO coverage only a few percent of Earth's surface?**

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

A: Because:
1. LEO satellites are relatively close to Earth (600-1200 km vs Earth's radius 6,371 km)
2. The coverage circle is determined by the central angle β₀
3. Even at 0° elevation (maximum coverage), the nadir angle is limited by geometry
4. Result: Only 1.69% to 7.95% of Earth covered at typical LEO altitudes

**Mnemonic**: "Low and Local" - LEOs fly low, so they see locally, not globally
</details>

---

## 📊 5.3 Coverage at Low Elevation - Critical Data

### Why Elevation Matters

- **0° elevation**: Maximum coverage BUT obstacles (buildings, mountains) block signal
- **Practical minimum**: 2° to 10° elevation for reliable communication
- **Trade-off**: Higher elevation = Better signal quality, Smaller coverage area

### 📈 Coverage Table (Memorize Key Values)

| Altitude | Elevation | Coverage |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **600 km** | 0° | **4.30%** |
| **600 km** | 10° | **1.69%** |
| **1200 km** | 0° | **7.95%** |
| **1200 km** | 10° | **4.20%** |

### 🔍 Pattern Recognition

Two key relationships (inverse proportional):
1. **↑ Elevation angle → ↓ Coverage** (for same altitude)
2. **↑ Altitude → ↑ Coverage** (for same elevation)

![Coverage Analysis](../../study_guide_figures/02_coverage_vs_params.png)

*Left plot shows the trade-off between elevation and coverage. Right plot shows how altitude affects coverage.*

---

## 📏 5.4 Coverage Belt

### Concept Visualization

![Coverage Belt](../../study_guide_figures/03_coverage_belt.png)

*This visualization shows how the satellite's coverage area sweeps across Earth's surface, creating a belt. The belt width determines the geographical area accessible during one orbital pass.*

### Belt Width Formula

**Maximum radius of coverage:**
$$d_{(\varepsilon_0=0)} = d_{max} = R_E\left[\sqrt{\left(\frac{H+R_E}{R_E}\right)^2 - 1}\right]$$
*(Equation 5.8)*

**Belt Width:**
$$D_{BELT} = 2d_{max}$$
*(Equation 5.9)*

### 📊 Belt Width Data

| Altitude | Elevation | Belt Width |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 600 km | 0° | 5,633 km |
| 600 km | 10° | 3,857 km |
| 1200 km | 0° | 8,178 km |
| 1200 km | 10° | 6,274 km |

### 🎯 Key Takeaway Box
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗

## 🌍 5.5 Global Coverage & Constellations

### Individual vs. Global Coverage

**Individual Coverage**: Single satellite covers small area (few %)

**Global Coverage**: Multiple satellites in constellation provide:
- Continuous service
- Real-time communication
- Worldwide accessibility

### The Coverage Problem

```
Single Satellite:
[Coverage Area moving] → [Leaves region] → [Communication lost]

Constellation:
[Sat 1] → [Handover] → [Sat 2] → [Handover] → [Sat 3]
         ↓                    ↓
   [Continuous Service]  [No gaps]
```

### 🔑 Critical Concepts

1. **Interoperability**: Satellites communicate with each other
2. **Handover**: Transfer of user from one satellite to another
3. **Overlapping Coverage**: Ensures smooth transitions (typically few degrees overlap)
4. **Intersatellite Links (ISL)**: Enable satellite-to-satellite communication

---

## 🛰️ 5.6 Starlink Case Study

### Three-Shell Architecture

| Shell | Satellites | Altitude |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| First | 1,440 | 550 km |
| Second | 2,825 | 1,110 km |
| Third | 7,500 | 340 km |

**Total planned**: ~12,000 satellites

### Coverage Comparison

**550 km altitude:**
- 0° elevation: 4.003%
- 40° elevation: 0.206%

**1,110 km altitude:**
- 0° elevation: 7.461%
- 40° elevation: 0.657%

### 💡 Why So Many Satellites?

At 550 km altitude, 40° elevation:
- Coverage per satellite: 0.206% of Earth
- Earth surface: 510 million km²
- Coverage area: ~1.05 million km² per satellite
- Radius: ~580 km

**To cover entire Earth with overlap → Thousands of satellites needed!**

## 🔄 5.7 Handover-Takeover Process

### Geometric Understanding

![Handover Process](../../study_guide_figures/06_handover_process.png)

*This radar view shows the handover zone where two satellites overlap in coverage. The blue satellite (Sat 1) is leaving while the red satellite (Sat 2) is entering the user's designed horizon. The green shaded area represents the critical overlap zone where seamless communication transfer occurs.*

### Key Events (Memorize!)

| Event | Meaning | Significance |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **AOS(0)** | Acquisition of Signal at 0° | Satellite enters ideal horizon |
| **AOS(40)** | Acquisition at 40° | Satellite enters designed horizon - **Communication starts** |
| **Max-El** | Maximum Elevation | Closest approach - strongest signal |
| **LOS(40)** | Loss of Signal at 40° | Satellite leaves designed horizon - **Communication ends** |
| **LOS(0)** | Loss at 0° | Satellite leaves ideal horizon |

### Handover Requirements

For successful handover at point B (overlap zone):
1. Sat 1 must reach LOS(40)
2. Sat 2 must reach AOS(40)
3. **Both satellites must be able to communicate with each other**
4. Distance between satellites: ~40 km (manageable for ISL)

## 💭 Active Recall Question #2

**Q: Calculate the coverage percentage for a satellite at 800 km altitude with 5° elevation. Use the formulas!**

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

Given:
- H = 800 km
- ε₀ = 5°
- RE = 6,371 km

Step 1: Calculate sin(α₀)
$$\sin\alpha_0 = \frac{6371}{6371 + 800}\cos(5°) = \frac{6371}{7171} \times 0.996 = 0.884$$

Step 2: Calculate α₀
$$\alpha_0 = \sin^{-1}(0.884) = 62.1°$$

Step 3: Calculate β₀
$$\beta_0 = 90° - 5° - 62.1° = 22.9°$$

Step 4: Calculate Coverage
$$C = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \cos(22.9°)) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - 0.921) = 0.0395 = 3.95\%$$

**Answer: 3.95% of Earth's surface**

# CHAPTER 6: LEO SUN SYNCHRONIZATION

## 🌞 6.1 Sun Synchronization Concept

### The Core Problem

For **photo imagery missions**, we need:
- Same lighting conditions for all images
- Consistent illumination across different passes
- Comparable data over time

### The Solution: Sun-Synchronous Orbits (SSO)

**Definition**: An orbit that maintains a **constant angle** between:
- The orbital plane normal vector, AND
- The Sun direction vector

Throughout the entire year!

### Seasonal Consistency

As Earth orbits the Sun throughout the year, the satellite's orbital plane precesses (via nodal regression) at exactly the right rate to keep a constant angle with the Sun direction.

![3D Sun-Synchronous Orbit](../../study_guide_figures/05_3d_sun_sync_orbit.png)

*This 3D visualization shows a sun-synchronous orbit (in blue) with Earth at the center. The yellow arrow points toward the Sun, and the orbital plane maintains a constant orientation relative to this Sun direction throughout the year. The equatorial plane is shown in light gray.*

---

## 🌍 6.2 Earth's Shape & Nodal Regression

### Why Earth's Shape Matters

**Perfect sphere**: Orbital plane would be fixed in space
**Reality (Oblate ellipsoid)**: Earth bulges at equator (~21 km)

This equatorial bulge creates an asymmetric gravitational field that causes orbital perturbations.

### J₂ Harmonic Coefficient

$$J_2 = 1.0827 \times 10^{-3}$$

This tiny number describes Earth's oblateness and causes **nodal regression**!

---

## 🔄 Nodal Regression Explained

### What is Nodal Regression?

The **line of nodes** (intersection of orbital plane with equatorial plane) shifts over time due to Earth's bulge.

### Visual Understanding

![Nodal Regression Analysis](../../study_guide_figures/04_nodal_regression.png)

*These plots show how nodal regression varies with inclination (left) and the critical sun-synchronous inclination window (right, shaded in green). The 600-1200 km altitude range creates a narrow 2.6° window for sun-synchronous orbits.*

### Direction Rules

| Inclination | cos(i) sign | Regression Direction |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **i < 90°** (Prograde) | Negative | **Westward** (opposite to Earth rotation) |
| **i = 90°** (Polar) | Zero | **No regression** |
| **i > 90°** (Retrograde) | Positive | **Eastward** (same as Earth rotation) |

### Master Formula for Nodal Regression

$$\frac{d\Omega}{dt} = -\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)n_0 A J_2 \cos i$$
*(Equation 6.2)*

Where:
- $n_0 = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ (mean satellite movement)
- $A = \frac{R_E^2}{r^2}$ (for circular orbits)
- T = orbital period

### Simplified for Circular LEO

$$\Delta\Omega = -2.06474 \times 10^{14} \cdot \frac{\cos i}{r^{7/2}} \quad [°/day]$$
*(Equation 6.7)*

---

## 📊 6.3 Nodal Regression Data

### Critical Values to Remember

| Altitude | Inclination | Nodal Regression |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 600 km | 90° | **0°/day** |
| 600 km | 100° | **+1.24°/day** |
| 600 km | 20° | **-6.74°/day** |
| 1200 km | 100° | **+0.94°/day** |

### 🎯 Pattern Box

## ☀️ 6.3 Achieving Sun Synchronization

### The Magic Number

Earth revolves around Sun once per year (365.25 days)

Angular rotation rate:
$$\frac{360°}{365.25 \text{ days}} = 0.986°/\text{day}$$

### The Synchronization Condition

$$\frac{d\Omega}{dt} = 0.9856°/\text{day}$$
*(Equation 6.8)*

### Solving for Inclination

From Equation 6.9:
$$-2.06474 \times 10^{14} \cdot \frac{\cos i}{r^{7/2}} = 0.9856$$

**For 600 km altitude** (r = 7000 km):
$$i_1 = 97.9°$$

**For 1200 km altitude** (r = 7600 km):
$$i_2 = 100.5°$$

---

## 🎯 6.3 The Inclination Window

### Sun-Synchronous Range

For LEO altitudes 600-1200 km:

$$\boxed{97.9° \leq i \leq 100.5°}$$

**Window width**: 2.6°

### Why This Matters

```
Below 97.9°:          Within Window:        Above 100.5°:
Not enough            Perfect Sun-sync!      Too much
regression            ✓                      regression
✗                                            ✗
```

### 💡 Active Recall Question #3

**Q: Why can't MEO or GEO satellites be Sun-synchronized?**

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

A: Because nodal regression depends on $r^{-7/2}$:

1. **LEO** (r ≈ 7,000 km): Regression ≈ 1°/day ✓
2. **MEO** (r ≈ 20,000 km): Regression ≈ 0.02°/day ✗
3. **GEO** (r ≈ 42,000 km): Regression ≈ 0.001°/day ✗

The regression becomes **negligible** at higher altitudes - not enough to match Earth's 0.986°/day rotation around the Sun!

**Mnemonic**: "High and Dry" - High orbits have dried up (negligible) nodal regression
</details>

## 🔧 6.4 Perigee Deviation

### What is Argument of Perigee (ω)?

The angle from the line of nodes to the orbital perigee (closest approach point).

### Why It Changes

Just like the line of nodes, Earth's oblateness causes the **major axis to rotate** within the orbital plane!

![Perigee Deviation](../../study_guide_figures/07_perigee_deviation.png)

*This diagram shows how the argument of perigee (ω) changes over time due to Earth's oblateness. The major axis of the orbit rotates within the orbital plane, causing the perigee point to drift. For sun-synchronous orbits, this deviation is approximately 10-13 arcminutes per orbit.*

### General Formula

$$\Delta\omega = 0.29\left[\frac{4-5\sin^2 i}{(1-e^2)^2}\right]\left[\left(\frac{D}{r_a + r_p}\right)^2\right]$$
*(Equation 6.12)*

Where:
- D = Earth's diameter
- ra, rp = apogee, perigee radii
- e = eccentricity

### For Circular LEO (e ≈ 0)

$$\Delta\omega = 0.29\left(\frac{R_E}{a}\right)[4 - 5\sin^2 i]$$
*(Equation 6.14)*

### Special Case: No Deviation!

$$\sin^2(63.4°) = 0.8 \rightarrow 4 - 5(0.8) = 0$$

**At i = 63.4°, there's NO perigee deviation!** (Used for Molnya orbits)

---

## 📊 Perigee Deviation for SSO

### For Sun-Sync Window (97.9° - 100.5°)

| Altitude | Inclination | Perigee Deviation |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 600 km | 97.9° | -0.219°/orbit = **-13.1'/orbit** |
| 600 km | 100.5° | -0.202°/orbit = **-12.1'/orbit** |
| 1200 km | 97.9° | -0.186°/orbit = **-11.2'/orbit** |
| 1200 km | 100.5° | -0.171°/orbit = **-10.3'/orbit** |

### Range for Sun-Sync Orbits

$$\boxed{10.3' \leq \Delta\omega \leq 13.1' \quad ['/\text{orbit}]}$$

**Direction**: Always opposite to satellite motion (negative)

## 🧠 Memory Palace Technique

Create a mental journey through these concepts:

**Room 1 - Coverage** (Living Room):
- Picture a satellite lamp casting a circular light (coverage area) on your floor
- The higher you raise it (altitude), the wider the circle
- Tilting your head (elevation angle) makes it harder to see the lamp

**Room 2 - Belt** (Hallway):
- Imagine the satellite lamp moving down the hallway
- It sweeps a belt of light as it moves
- Width depends on lamp height

**Room 3 - Constellation** (Kitchen):
- Multiple lamps (satellites) covering the whole kitchen
- As one dims (LOS), another brightens (AOS)
- Smooth handover like passing a baton

**Room 4 - Sun Sync** (Bedroom):
- Window always faces the same direction to the Sun
- Earth's lumpiness (pillow under sheets) makes the bed tilt
- Tilt rate of 0.986°/day keeps Sun angle constant
- Only retrograde beds (tilted backwards >90°) can maintain this!

**Room 5 - Deviations** (Bathroom):
- Mirror rotates (nodal regression) due to Earth's bulge
- Toothbrush rotates in holder (perigee deviation)
- Both caused by Earth not being a perfect sphere
