- Space Weather Operations contracts - Service contracts, not R&D

**Conclusion**: NOAA focuses on purchasing commercial data, not funding university CubeSat development

---

## PART 2: KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Active Opportunities RIGHT NOW (November 2025):

**1. ROSES 2025 Astrophysics Pioneers (D.5)** - BEST CURRENT OPTION
- ✅ Accepts CubeSat proposals
- ✅ Step-1 deadline: January 23, 2026 (2+ months away)
- ✅ Science-focused (matches academic environment)
- ✅ Technology development allowed (but science merit is key)

**Recommendation**: If you have an astrophysics/astronomy mission concept, this is your best bet RIGHT NOW.

**2. ROSES 2025 Heliophysics Programs** - GOOD IF SPACE WEATHER FOCUSED
- ✅ Multiple programs accepting proposals
- ✅ Deadlines vary (check Tables 2 & 3)
- ⚠️ Government funding lapse may delay responses
- ✅ Strong fit for space weather missions (AURORA SHIELD, PLASMA-PROBE)

**Recommendation**: Check specific Heliophysics program deadlines if your mission is space weather related.

---

### Opportunities Coming Soon:

**1. NASA CSLI (Spring 2026)**
- Expected announcement: March-May 2026
- Expected deadline: August-November 2026
- **Action**: Start preparing proposal now, submit when opens

**2. Air Force UNP (Likely January 2026)**
- Expected announcement: January 2026
- Expected deadline: February 2026
- **Action**: Monitor universitynanosat.org starting December 2025

**3. NSF CubeSat (TBD)**
- Status uncertain
- **Action**: Contact NSF Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences division

---

### Reality Check:

**Most "RFP-aligned" missions I created are based on programs that**:
1. ✅ Actually exist (ESTO, NSF, NOAA priorities are real)
2. ❌ Don't have active solicitations open RIGHT NOW (November 2025)
3. ⚠️ May open in future cycles (ESTO InVEST, CSLI 2026)

**What This Means**:
- My "RFP-aligned" Category 2 missions are still valid concepts
- They just need to wait for solicitations to open
- Or be adapted to ROSES 2025 Astrophysics/Heliophysics programs

---

## PART 3: COMPREHENSIVE LLM RESEARCH PLAN
