# Mission Rankings - Innovation/Impact Prioritized
**Weighting Based on Your Priorities**

---

## Adjusted Weighting Formula

Since you prioritize innovation/impact over selection probability (but selection still matters):

**New Weights**:
- **Impact**: 30% (increased - most important real-world value)
- **Novelty**: 30% (increased - innovation priority)
- **CSLI Score**: 30% (decreased but still significant - selection matters)
- **Interest Level**: 10% (tie-breaker)

## THE HAPPY MEDIUM: Top 2 Recommendations

### Option A: **CRYPTO-SAT** 👑
**Why it's the sweet spot**:
- ✅ **5/5 Novelty** - First space-based quantum RNG (completely unprecedented)
- ✅ **4/5 Impact** - Secure communications for millions
- ✅ **83% CSLI** - Strong selection probability
- ✅ **Lowest cost** - $40k (lowest risk)
- ✅ **Smallest form factor** - 1U (simplest)
- ✅ **Your top interest level** - Cutting-edge tech
- ✅ **DoD co-funding potential** - National security angle

**The balance**: Extremely innovative + good CSLI score + lowest cost/risk

**Tradeoff**: Slightly lower impact than AURORA SHIELD or LITHIUM HUNTER (but still high at 4/5)

---

### Option B: **AURORA SHIELD** 👑
**Why it's the sweet spot**:
- ✅ **5/5 Impact** - Protects astronauts, satellites, power grids (transformative)
- ✅ **4/5 Novelty** - First distributed radiation network (highly innovative)
- ✅ **85% CSLI** - Even stronger selection probability
- ✅ **Space Weather** - Top NASA CSLI priority
- ✅ **Protects Starlink** - Commercial partnership angle
- ✅ **Clear NASA benefit** - ISS safety, satellite protection

**The balance**: Transformative impact + highly innovative + excellent CSLI score

**Tradeoff**: Slightly less novel than CRYPTO-SAT (4/5 vs 5/5), moderate interest level (2 vs 1)

## What About LITHIUM HUNTER?

**LITHIUM HUNTER** is still #1 overall (85.5) because of perfect 10/10 innovation+impact, BUT:

**The CSLI Challenge**:
- 80% predicted CSLI score (vs 83-85% for sweet spot options)
- Higher cost $85k (vs $40-60k)
- Hyperspectral imager more complex than other payloads

**What this means**:
- You'll need a **stronger proposal** to compensate for lower CSLI score
- Funding is more challenging ($85k vs $40k)
- **BUT** if you nail the proposal, the innovation/impact are unmatched

**Risk vs Reward**:
- **Higher risk**: Lower CSLI probability, higher cost
- **Higher reward**: Industry-creating mission, perfect alignment with space mining passion
