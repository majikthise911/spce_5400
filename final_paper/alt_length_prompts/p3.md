- **Tone**: Technical but accessible, confident but not arrogant
- **Goal**: Engagement (likes, retweets), followers, potential collaborators

## Thread Structure

### THREAD 1: The Hook (Main Thread, 18 tweets)

**Tweet 1 - The Hook (280 chars max)**
Template options:

Option A:
"Your smartphone is 100× more powerful than a Mars rover's computer.

Why? Because space radiation would kill your phone in weeks.

I'm building a satellite with an AI that knows when space is trying to kill it—and fights back.

Here's how: 🧵 [1/18]"

Option B:
"NASA is spending $50M building the next-gen space computer.

But missions launching in 2025-2027 can't wait.

So I'm building a $120k satellite that bridges the gap using an AI smart enough to protect itself.

Thread on autonomous radiation-aware computing: 🧵 [1/18]"

**Tweet 2 - The Problem Setup**
"First, the problem:

NASA's Artemis program needs autonomous landing on the Moon.

Mars Sample Return needs real-time hazard detection.

Both require AI processing in space. But there's a catch... [2/18]"

**Tweet 3 - The Catch**
"Space radiation destroys electronics.

Cosmic rays and solar particles hit satellites 24/7, flipping bits in computer memory and burning out circuits.

Your phone would die in weeks. Laptop? Days.

This is why space computers are so primitive. [3/18]"

**Tweet 4 - Current Solution**
"The workaround? Radiation-hardened processors like the BAE RAD750.

Specs:
- 200 MHz (your phone: 3,000 MHz)
- $200,000 each
- 1996-era performance
- Basically runs on a Pentium processor

Mars rovers use this. It's embarrassingly slow. [4/18]"

**Tweet 5 - The Coming Solution**
"NASA's fix: HPSC (High Performance Spaceflight Computing)

- 100× faster than RAD750
- $50M development
- Available 2025... but won't be in most missions until 2027-2028

Cool! Except: what do you use if you're launching a satellite in 2025-2026? [5/18]"

**Tweet 6 - The Gap**
"This 2-3 year gap is critical:

- Artemis missions in planning NOW
- 5,000+ LEO satellites launching (Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb)
- Space startups can't wait for 2028
- Commercial missions can't afford $50M processor development

Enter: RAD-AI 🛰️ [6/18]"

**Tweet 7 - The Insight**
"Here's the key insight nobody else tried:

What if instead of building AI that IGNORES radiation, you build AI that DETECTS radiation and ADAPTS in real-time?

Like a self-driving car with tire pressure sensors—it doesn't have indestructible tires, it adapts to damage. [7/18]"

**Tweet 8 - The Solution Overview**
"RAD-AI is a shoebox-sized satellite (6U CubeSat) with:

✅ RISC-V processor (proven in space: TRISAT-R, 2022)
✅ AI accelerator (FPGA-based inference)
✅ Radiation sensors (real-time TID + SEU monitoring)
✅ Autonomous mode switching

Let me explain that last part... [8/18]"

**Tweet 9 - Autonomous Adaptation**
"The novel part: The AI monitors its own radiation environment.

When it detects high radiation (like the South Atlantic Anomaly—a radiation 'pothole' in Earth's magnetic field):

1. Slows AI processing (10 Hz → 3 Hz)
2. Increases error-checking (TMR)
3. Logs everything [9/18]"

**Tweet 10 - Specific Example**
"Concrete example:

Orbit: 500 km altitude, 94 min period
SAA passes: 6-10 times per day, 10× radiation spike

Normal operations:
- 10 Hz AI inference
- Standard error checking
- 36W power

SAA passage:
- 3 Hz AI inference
- Triple redundancy
- 24W power

All automatic. [10/18]"

**Tweet 11 - The Tech Stack**
"The tech stack (all proven separately, novel in combination):

🔧 SiFive U74 RISC-V (1.5 GHz quad-core)
🔧 Lattice FPGA AI accelerator
🔧 Triple Modular Redundancy (every calc runs 3×, vote on answer)
🔧 2mm tantalum shielding (10× dose reduction)
🔧 RADFETs + cosmic ray telescope [11/18]"

**Tweet 12 - Why It Matters (Artemis)**
"Impact #1: Artemis

$93B program needs autonomous precision landing.

Problem: Moon surface hazard detection requires 30 Hz AI processing. If radiation kills the AI mid-landing? Mission failure.

RAD-AI proves COTS AI + mitigation can work with autonomous adaptation. [12/18]"

**Tweet 13 - Why It Matters (Mars)**
"Impact #2: Mars Sample Return

$11B mission to bring rocks back from Mars.

Communication delay: 6-44 minutes.
Navigation: 100% autonomous.

If AI fails due to radiation 140M miles from home? You're not getting a repair crew.

RAD-AI tests adaptive AI for deep space. [13/18]"

**Tweet 14 - Why It Matters (Constellations)**
"Impact #3: LEO Constellations

5,000+ satellites launching 2025-2027.

Need onboard processing for:
- Beamforming
- Interference rejection
- Anomaly detection

RAD750? Too expensive. HPSC? Not available yet.

RAD-AI validates COTS+mitigation path at 1/10th cost. [14/18]"

**Tweet 15 - By The Numbers**
"The economics:

Development: $120,000
- Blue Canyon 6U bus: $82k
- Custom AI payload: $28k
- Testing: $10k

Launch: FREE (NASA CSLI program, ~$250k value)

Compare: NASA HPSC development: $50,000,000

We're 1/400th the cost for bridge technology. [15/18]"

**Tweet 16 - Timeline**
"The timeline:

📍 Nov 2024: Outline complete (50/50 grade)
📍 Dec 2024: Final design document (expecting 97-100%)
📍 Mar 2025: Submit NASA CSLI application (est. 55-65% selection probability)
📍 Sep 2025: Award notification
📍 2026-2027: Build, test, launch [16/18]"

**Tweet 17 - The Dataset**
"The deliverable:

First public dataset showing COTS AI accuracy degradation in orbital radiation environment.

📊 360+ SAA passes
📊 5-10 krad total dose
📊 12-month accuracy tracking
📊 SEU rate correlation

Open-source release for future mission designers. [17/18]"

**Tweet 18 - CTA**
"TL;DR: Building a satellite with AI smart enough to protect itself from space radiation.

Bridge tech for 2025-2027 gap before NASA's HPSC.

$120k university project. NASA CSLI launch. Open-source data.

### THREAD 2: Technical Deep-Dive (Optional Follow-Up, 10 tweets)

Post this 2-3 days after main thread if engagement is strong.

**Tweet 1**
"A lot of you asked: 'How exactly does the autonomous radiation detection work?'

Let me break down the technical approach.

Deep dive on RAD-AI's sensing and adaptation system: 🧵 [1/10]"

**Tweet 2 - Detection Mechanism**
"Detection uses two inputs:

1️⃣ RADFETs (radiation-sensitive transistors)
   • Threshold voltage shifts with total dose
   • <1 min latency
   
2️⃣ Orbital position + pre-computed SAA map
   • SPENVIS analysis
   • Predicts radiation zones

ML classifier combines both → mode decision [2/10]"

**Tweet 3 - TMR Implementation**
"Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) implementation:

- Instruction-level redundancy (not application-level)
- LLVM compiler pass inserts voting logic
- Hardware voter in FPGA (<100 ns latency)
- Measured overhead: 2.8× (breadboard validation)

This is why 10 Hz → 3 Hz in protected mode [3/10]"

## Writing Guidelines for X/Twitter

**DO:**
- Start with a hook (surprising fact, question, bold claim)
- Use line breaks generously (every 1-2 sentences)
- Include emojis sparingly (🛰️🚀📊✅⏳🚧) for visual scanning
- Use bullet points with emoji bullets
- Tag relevant accounts (@NASA, @SiFive, component manufacturers)
- Include visuals when possible (diagrams, renders, photos)
- End with clear CTA (follow, ask questions, share)

**DON'T:**
- Wall of text (break every 1-2 sentences)
- Overuse hashtags (#space #cubesat works, #space #cubesat #nasa #ai #engineering is spam)
- Be defensive about limitations (confidence, not arrogance)
- Apologize for technical depth (your audience wants it)
- Use academic passive voice ("is detected by" → "detects")

**Character Limits:**
- Standard tweet: 280 characters
- With X Premium: Up to 25,000 characters (but optimal is still <280 for engagement)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Ask questions in thread ("What would you ask a satellite if you could?")
- Tag relevant people/orgs when appropriate (but not spammy)
- Reply to your own thread with additional details (keeps engagement going)
