# TASK: Convert RAD-AI Full Design Document to SmallSat Conference Paper

## Context
I have a comprehensive 24,500-word CubeSat preliminary design document (RAD-AI mission) that I need to convert into an 8-10 page conference paper for the AIAA/USU SmallSat Conference.

## Input Document
[Paste your full RAD-AI Rev 2.0 document here]

## Target Specifications
- **Length**: 4,000-5,000 words (8-10 pages double-column IEEE format)
- **Audience**: CubeSat researchers, practitioners, NASA/industry professionals
- **Focus**: What's novel (autonomous radiation-aware AI computing) + preliminary design
- **Tone**: Technical but accessible, emphasize innovation and problem validation

## Required Structure

### 1. INTRODUCTION (500 words)
- Problem statement: AI autonomy needs vs. radiation vulnerability
- Gap analysis: RAD750 too slow (200 MHz), commercial AI fails in radiation
- Solution overview: Adaptive radiation-aware computing with real-time mode switching
- Paper roadmap

**Key elements to preserve:**
- NASA Artemis/MSR validation quotes (demonstrates need)
- "Bridge technology" positioning during HPSC transition (2025-2027)
- Clear differentiation from Phi-Sat-1 (static AI) and TRISAT-R (no autonomy)

**Cut from original:**
- Extensive heritage discussion (condense to 2-3 sentences)
- Detailed market analysis (brief mention only)
- All background that doesn't directly support novelty claim

### 2. BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK (400 words)
- Phi-Sat-1 (2020): First AI CubeSat, static cloud detection
- TRISAT-R (2022): RISC-V fault tolerance, no AI integration
- NASA HPSC: Deep-space solution, not available until 2025+
- Commercial efforts: Cosmic Shielding 2024 success validates market
- Gap: No existing system demonstrates autonomous radiation adaptation

**Key message:** "We build on proven technologies (RISC-V, TMR, AI inference) but combine them with novel autonomous adaptation capability."

### 3. MISSION ARCHITECTURE (800 words)
Brief system overview, then focus on AI payload:

**3.1 System Overview (150 words)**
- 6U CubeSat, 500 km LEO, 12-month mission
- Hybrid approach: COTS bus + custom AI payload
- Primary objective: Demonstrate radiation-aware autonomous computing

**3.2 AI Payload Design (650 words)** [CORE OF PAPER]
- **Processing**: SiFive U74 RISC-V (TRISAT-R heritage) + Lattice CrossLink-NX FPGA
- **Mitigation**: 4-layer approach
  - Instruction-level TMR (2.8× overhead measured on breadboard)
  - 2mm tantalum shielding (0.3× dose reduction)
  - EDAC memory protection
  - Watchdog timers
- **Sensors**: RADFETs (TID tracking) + Cosmic Ray Telescope (SEU correlation)

Include Figure 1: AI Payload Block Diagram (RISC-V → FPGA → Sensors → TMR voting logic)

**Cut from original:**
- Detailed component specifications (part numbers, voltages)
- Complete subsystem descriptions (ADCS, comms, power budget tables)
- Testing procedures

### 4. AUTONOMOUS RADIATION-AWARE OPERATION (1,000 words) [NOVEL CONTRIBUTION]
This is THE key section - allocate most space here.

**4.1 Real-Time Radiation Detection (300 words)**
- Dual-input detection:
  - RADFET voltage monitoring (<1 min latency)
  - Orbital position prediction (SPENVIS pre-computed SAA boundaries)
- ML classifier trained on orbital radiation data
- Detection threshold: >3σ above baseline triggers mode change

**4.2 Autonomous Mode Switching (400 words)**
Three operational modes:

| Mode | AI Frequency | TMR Level | Power | Trigger Condition |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Normal | 10 Hz | Standard | 36 W | Low radiation (<2 krad/day) |
| Protected | 3 Hz | Enhanced | 24 W | SAA passage (>5 krad/day) |
| Safe | Minimal | Maximum | 12 W | SEU spike (>10 upsets/min) |

- State machine with hysteresis (prevents mode thrashing)
- Autonomous transition: No ground command required
- Example: Detects SAA entry → reduces processing 3.3× → increases TMR voting → exits SAA → resumes normal ops

Include Figure 2: Mode Switching Flowchart (decision tree with thresholds)

**4.3 Performance Monitoring (300 words)**
- Continuous logging: AI accuracy, SEU rate, TID accumulation, mode transitions
- Post-mission analysis dataset (open source planned)
- Expected degradation: <5% accuracy loss over 12 months (vs. >20% unmitigated)

**Key insight to emphasize:** "Unlike previous AI CubeSats that run static algorithms, RAD-AI actively senses its radiation environment and adjusts computing strategy in real-time—critical for deep-space missions where ground intervention is impossible due to communication delays."

### 5. MISSION DESIGN & FEASIBILITY (600 words)

**5.1 Link Budget Summary (150 words)**
- UHF 9600 bps downlink: 155 dB margin
- Supports 20 MB/day with 3:1 JPEG compression
- Ground segment: University station + SatNOGS backup

**5.2 Radiation Environment (200 words)**
- SPENVIS analysis: 5-10 krad/year at 500 km
- 6-10 SAA passages daily (orbital period 94 min)
- Validates autonomous mode switching requirement

**5.3 Development Approach (250 words)**
- Hybrid: COTS 6U bus (Blue Canyon XACT, $82k) + custom AI payload ($28k)
- TRL assessment: Mix 4-6 (RISC-V: TRL 6, TMR software: TRL 5, integration: TRL 4)
- Timeline: 42 months (PDR M10 → CDR M18 → Launch M36-42)
- Funding: NASA CSLI (free launch ~$250k value) + university grants ($100-120k development)

Include Table 1: Key Mission Parameters (compact 5-row summary)

**Cut from original:**
- Detailed thermal analysis (mention "thermal margin 15°C" in passing)
- Mass budget specifics (just state "11.5 kg with 18% margin")
- Extensive FMEA (mention "top risks: latchup, transceiver failure—mitigated via current limiting and redundant ground stations")

### 6. EXPECTED RESULTS (300 words) [IF PRE-LAUNCH] or PRELIMINARY RESULTS [IF POST-BREADBOARD]

**Pre-launch version:**
- Success criteria: 30 days minimum, 6 months baseline, 12 months full

## References (30-40, most important only)
**MUST include:**
- NASA Artemis Plan 2024 [1]
- Mars Sample Return Campaign [4]
- NASA HPSC Overview [7]
- Phi-Sat-1 papers [5, 8]

**Cut:** Manufacturer datasheets, detailed component references, management documents

## Writing Style Guidelines
- **Active voice**: "RAD-AI detects radiation spikes and adjusts processing" NOT "Radiation spikes are detected by RAD-AI"
- **Concrete examples**: "During SAA passage (6-10 times daily), the system automatically reduces AI processing from 10 Hz to 3 Hz"
- **Quantitative claims**: Always cite: "2.8× performance overhead [measured on breadboard]" or "[predicted via SPENVIS analysis]"
- **No marketing language**: Avoid "revolutionary," "groundbreaking," "first-ever" unless backed by explicit evidence
- **Technical precision**: "Instruction-level TMR with hardware voting" NOT "advanced error correction"

## Sections to ELIMINATE Entirely from Original
❌ Assignment #3 outline sections
❌ Detailed requirements tables (COM-001, POW-001, etc.) - mention "27 requirements across 5 categories" in passing
❌ Trade study tables (processor selection, FPGA comparison) - condense to brief justification paragraphs
❌ Detailed test procedures (step-by-step board power-on, etc.)
❌ Complete subsystem specifications (power budget 35 rows, mass budget detail)
❌ Project management (WBS, Gantt charts, detailed risk register)
❌ CSLI selection probability analysis (not relevant for technical publication)
❌ Sponsor interactions, team interactions sections
❌ Month-by-month prediction tables

## Key Differentiation to Emphasize
Make crystal clear what's novel:

**NOT novel (acknowledge these):**
- RISC-V in space (TRISAT-R did it)
- AI inference in space (Phi-Sat-1 did it)
- TMR mitigation (standard technique since 1960s)
- Radiation shielding (common approach)

**IS novel (this is YOUR contribution):**
- **Real-time radiation detection coupled with autonomous mode switching**
- **AI system that senses and responds to its environment**
- **Closed-loop feedback: detect radiation → adjust processing → validate mitigation**
- **Demonstration during critical HPSC transition window (2025-2027)**
