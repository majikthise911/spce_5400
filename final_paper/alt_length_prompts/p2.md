## Required Structure

### Title (Choose 1 style)
**Option A - Problem-focused:** "Why Your Smartphone Is Smarter Than a Mars Rover (And How We're Fixing That)"

**Option B - Story-driven:** "Building an AI Satellite That Knows When Space Is Trying to Kill It"

**Option C - Provocative:** "The $50 Million Problem With a $120,000 Solution"

### Opening Hook (150 words)
Start with a compelling scenario:

**Example opening:**
"Imagine you're landing on Mars. Your spacecraft is screaming toward the surface at 12,000 mph. There are boulders everywhere. You need to decide where to land. Right now.

There's just one problem: Earth is 140 million miles away. Any message to mission control takes 6 to 44 minutes to arrive. By the time they respond, you're already a crater.

This isn't science fiction. This is NASA's Artemis program and Mars Sample Return mission—and it's why spacecraft need AI to think for themselves.

But here's the catch: The computer in your pocket is 100× more powerful than the ones we send to space. Why? Because space is trying to kill your electronics with radiation. And the radiation-hardened computers we use are stuck in the 1990s.

Until now."

### Section 1: The Problem Nobody Talks About (400 words)

**Narrative structure:**
1. **Spacecraft need to be smart now** (Artemis autonomous landing, Mars communication delays)
2. **But space is hostile to electronics** (radiation explanation in simple terms)
3. **The current solution is embarrassingly slow** (RAD750: 200 MHz vs. your phone: 3,000 MHz)

**Analogies to use:**
- "The RAD750 processor that runs Mars rovers has the computing power of a 1996 iMac"
- "Imagine trying to play a modern video game on a computer from 'Toy Story' era"
- "Space radiation is like getting shot with tiny bullets 24/7—your phone would die in weeks"

**Include this data point:**
"NASA's solution? The High Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) processor, a $50 million development effort that's 100× faster than current space computers. Great! Except it won't be available until 2025, and most missions won't fly with it until 2027-2028."

**The gap:**
"So what do you do if you're launching a satellite in 2025-2026? What if you're a startup building a constellation of 500 satellites and can't wait for NASA's $50M processor?

That's the question I asked myself. And the answer surprised me."

### Section 2: What If Your AI Could Protect Itself? (500 words)

**The key insight (explain like this):**
"Here's what nobody was trying: What if instead of building a computer that ignores radiation, you built a computer that *knows* it's being irradiated and adapts in real-time?

Think of it like a self-driving car. The car doesn't have indestructible tires—it has sensors that detect tire pressure dropping and adjusts driving accordingly. What if spacecraft AI did the same with radiation?"

**Introduce the solution (RAD-AI mission):**
"That's what RAD-AI does. It's a shoebox-sized satellite (a 'CubeSat') with an AI brain that:
1. Senses when it's entering high-radiation zones (like the South Atlantic Anomaly—basically a radiation pothole in Earth's magnetic field)
2. Automatically slows down its processing and increases error-checking
3. Speeds back up when radiation drops
4. Learns from every pass and logs what works"

**The clever part:**
"We're not inventing new technology. We're combining existing pieces in a new way:
- **The processor**: RISC-V chip already proven in space (TRISAT-R satellite, 2022)
- **The error-checking**: Triple Modular Redundancy—every calculation runs three times, vote on the answer (1960s NASA technique)
- **The shielding**: 2mm tantalum metal box (same stuff as jet engine parts)
- **The AI**: Standard computer vision, but smart enough to monitor its own radiation environment

The novel part? The AI watches its own sensors and says 'Uh oh, radiation is spiking—time to switch to safe mode' without waiting for ground control."

**Use this analogy:**
"It's like your phone detecting low battery and switching to power-saving mode. Except instead of battery, it's detecting 'am I about to get fried by cosmic rays?'"

**Include a specific scenario:**
"Example: The satellite is orbiting Earth every 94 minutes. Six to ten times per day, it flies through the South Atlantic Anomaly—a region where Earth's magnetic field is weak and radiation is 10× higher. 

Most satellites just suffer through it and hope nothing breaks. RAD-AI detects it coming (using position + radiation sensors), switches from '10 frames per second' AI processing to '3 frames per second' with triple-checking, gets through the SAA, then resumes normal operations.

All automatic. No ground commands needed."

### Section 3: Why This Matters (Beyond Cool Tech) (400 words)

**Frame the impact:**

**1. Mars Sample Return ($11 billion mission)**
"NASA is planning to bring rocks back from Mars—the first interplanetary sample return mission. The spacecraft needs to:
- Navigate autonomously (40-minute communication delays)
- Make landing decisions in real-time
- Process hazard detection at 10 Hz

If the AI computer fails due to radiation, $11 billion gone. RAD-AI's approach could provide backup computing or inform how they design redundancy."

**2. Artemis Moon Landing ($93 billion program)**
"Artemis astronauts will land on the Moon using autonomous precision landing—no more 'pick a flat spot and hope for the best.' They need real-time hazard detection analyzing camera feeds at 30 Hz.

Same problem: High-performance computing in radiation. RAD-AI provides data on how COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) AI degrades in space radiation—critical for designing these systems."

**3. The Coming Satellite Boom (5,000+ satellites, 2025-2027)**
"Starlink, OneWeb, Amazon Kuiper—thousands of satellites launching soon. They all need onboard processing (beam-forming, interference rejection, anomaly detection).

RAD750? Too expensive ($200k+ per processor) and too slow. HPSC? Not available yet. Commercial AI chips? They fail in space. 

RAD-AI shows a middle path: COTS components + software mitigation + radiation awareness = good enough for LEO constellations at 1/10th the cost."

**Include this quote:**
"As one space startup founder told me: 'We need AI in space yesterday, not in 2027 when HPSC is available. We're launching satellites in 2025. What do we use?'

That's who this is for."

### Section 4: The Build (What's Actually Happening) (300 words)

**Make it concrete:**

**Size:** "Shoebox-sized: 20cm × 10cm × 34cm, about 11.5 kg (25 lbs)"

**Cost:** "$120,000 total. For context:
- Mars rover computer: ~$500k
- HPSC development: $50 million
- Single SpaceX Falcon 9 launch: $67 million
- RAD-AI gets free launch via NASA's CubeSat program (worth ~$250k)"

**Timeline:** "42 months from design to launch:
- Months 1-10: Preliminary design
- Months 11-18: Detailed design (the work is here)
- Months 19-30: Build and test
- Months 31-36: Final testing and NASA reviews
- Months 37-42: Wait for launch slot

Target launch: 2026-2027"

**The team:** "This is my Master's degree project at UCCS (University of Colorado Colorado Springs). The approach combines:
- Space engineering coursework (CubeSat design)
- Industry background (I spent 5 years in grid-scale energy before pivoting to space)
- Open-source hardware (RISC-V, Lattice FPGA dev kits)
- NASA resources (free launch, radiation testing facilities)"

**The hook:** "If NASA's CubeSat program selects us (estimated 55-65% chance based on scoring methodology—see appendix), we fly for free. If not, we're exploring commercial launch options or resubmitting next cycle."

### Section 5: What Success Looks Like (250 words)

**Success criteria (frame as milestones):**

**Minimum success (30 days):** "Prove the satellite works at all. Send telemetry, confirm AI is running, validate radiation sensors."

**Baseline success (6 months):** "Collect meaningful data: 180+ passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly, document autonomous mode switches, measure AI accuracy degradation vs. predictions."

**Full success (12 months):** "Complete scientific dataset:
- 360+ SAA passes
- Full radiation exposure (5-10 krad accumulated dose—equivalent to 50,000 chest X-rays)
- AI accuracy tracked over full mission
- Open-source dataset released for other missions to use"

**The data everyone wants:**
"How fast does AI accuracy degrade in space? We don't really know. NVIDIA tested their Jetson chips on the ground under simulated radiation—they predicted 'marginally sufficient for three-year LEO mission.' But what does that mean in practice?

RAD-AI will provide the first public dataset showing: 'Here's what happens to COTS AI accuracy month-by-month in orbit.' That's worth millions to satellite designers who need this data to make build-vs-buy decisions."

### Section 6: The Bigger Picture (200 words)

**Bridge technology narrative:**

"RAD-AI isn't competing with NASA's HPSC. Think of it as the bridge that gets us there.

**2025-2027 gap:**
- Early missions need AI now (Artemis, Mars Sample Return in planning)
- LEO constellations launching by the thousands
- HPSC won't be widely available until 2027-2028
- Commercial missions can't afford $50M processor development

**RAD-AI's role:**
- Provides empirical data during critical transition
- Validates that COTS+mitigation works for LEO
- Demonstrates autonomous radiation-aware computing (relevant even for HPSC missions)
- Costs 1/400th of HPSC development ($120k vs. $50M)

It's like building electric scooters while waiting for flying cars. The flying cars are coming (HPSC), but we need transportation today (COTS AI with mitigation)."

**End with forward-looking statement:**
"By the time HPSC is common (2028-2030), mission designers will have real data showing: 'Here's how COTS AI degrades, here's what mitigation works, here's how to design autonomous radiation-aware systems.' That's the knowledge base we're building."

### Closing: Why I'm Building This (200 words)

**Personal narrative (authentic, not sales-y):**

"I came to space from energy. I spent five years designing grid-scale solar and battery projects—100 MW installations, multi-million dollar procurements. When I decided to pivot to aerospace, I asked: 'What problem in space feels like the energy transition?'

Answer: AI autonomy. Everyone knows we need it. Everyone knows current solutions are too slow or too expensive. And there's a 2-3 year window where no great solution exists.

That's the opportunity.

RAD-AI won't change everything. But if we can show that a $120k university project can validate COTS AI in space during the exact window when 5,000 satellites are launching, that's valuable.

And if we can demonstrate that AI systems can autonomously sense and respond to radiation—that's a capability Mars missions will need.

So that's what we're building. A shoebox-sized satellite that's smarter about surviving space than anything before it.

Stay tuned for launch updates."

## Writing Style Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use analogies (cars, phones, batteries, video games)
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max for web readability)
- Bold key phrases for scanning
- Second-person occasionally ("Imagine you're landing on Mars")
- Active voice ("RAD-AI detects radiation and adjusts" not "Radiation is detected by RAD-AI")
- Specific numbers ("2.8× performance overhead" not "significant overhead")
- Explain acronyms once, then use freely

**DON'T:**
- Use jargon without explanation ("SEU" → "single-event upset (bit flip)" first time)
- Assume reader knows space terminology
- Make it sound like a grant proposal
- Oversell ("revolutionary" "groundbreaking" unless truly first)
- Hide the interesting parts in technical details

**Tone examples:**

❌ BAD: "The system implements instruction-level Triple Modular Redundancy with hardware voting mechanisms to achieve error detection and correction in the presence of radiation-induced single-event upsets."

✅ GOOD: "Every calculation runs three times. If one copy gets corrupted by radiation, the other two outvote it. It's like having three people do the same math problem—if one gets it wrong, the other two catch it."

❌ BAD: "Mission architecture leverages flight-proven RISC-V processors coupled with FPGA-based AI acceleration."

✅ GOOD: "We're using a RISC-V chip (already proven on another satellite in 2022) connected to an AI accelerator chip. Think of it like a CPU + GPU setup in a gaming computer, but radiation-hardened."
