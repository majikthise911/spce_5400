Assignment #3
Due Nov 2 by 11:59pm Points 50 Submitting a file upload Available Oct 7 at 12am - Dec 31 at 11:59pm
Read assignment

1) Read Textbook Chapter 6 : Sun Synchronous [ read for comprehension, but no problem sets assigned on this chapter ] 

2) Begin your project!   Read sections 1-3 of CubeSat 101 : Basic Concepts and Processes for first time Cubesat developers.  [ already uploaded to Background module ].   Now, consider a novel space mission [ or an extension of an existing mission ] that sparks your interest: commercial, research/exploratory, defense, etc.  Keep the scope reasonable.   Follow the CubeSat 101 process and create a first draft outline [ sections: Intro, Process, Mission Models] that would serve to describe the Cubesat [ as you'll see - there are many configurations possible] with sufficient detail that might attract funding.    

If you have any preliminary ideas, that you'll like show me early on, please do!

 

** this project will be worth 200 pts total.  The outline is the first increment, worth 50 pts, to augmented the remainder of the Cubesat 101 sections later.

Well done, your outline is quite complete.  Press forward with a design and provide as much detail as possible. It's clear that you've done research on components, etc. I'm really excited to see the final report.  Let me know if I can help further.

Really appreciate the encouragement. This topic is very exciting to me, and given my background being in energy rather than sat coms, I hope I can deliver a solid design.
