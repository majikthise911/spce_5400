# AI Image Prompts for RAD-AI Appendix A

Use these prompts with DALL-E 3 (via ChatGPT Plus or Bing Image Creator), Midjourney, or Leonardo.ai to generate conceptual renders for Appendix A.

**Tip:** Run each prompt 2-3 times and pick the best result. You can add "photorealistic" or "technical illustration" to adjust the style.

## Figure A.3: Exploded View - Internal Layers

```
Technical exploded view diagram of a 6U CubeSat showing four internal
layers separated vertically: bottom layer contains rectangular battery
pack with cylindrical 18650 cells visible, second layer shows shielded
electronics box with metallic enclosure, third layer displays green
circuit boards with electronic components, top layer shows antenna
deployment mechanism, all layers aligned vertically with slight
separation, aluminum structural rails visible on corners connecting
all layers, clean white background, engineering cutaway illustration

## Figure A.4: AI Payload Shielding Configuration

```
Technical 3D render of a small metallic shielding enclosure box,
rectangular tantalum metal box approximately 8cm x 6cm x 3cm with
thick 2mm walls, lid slightly separated to show interior, inside
contains two square microchip packages (processor and FPGA) and two
rectangular memory modules, dense silvery-gray metallic material
with machined finish, radiation shielding enclosure for spacecraft
electronics, engineering product photography style, three-quarter
view on white background, photorealistic, no text

## Figure A.5: Solar Array Deployment Sequence (3-Panel)

```
Technical illustration showing three sequential states of CubeSat
solar panel deployment from left to right: State 1 shows rectangular
satellite body with solar panel folded flat against side, State 2
shows panel partially rotated at 45 degrees with spring hinge visible,
State 3 shows panel fully deployed at 90 degrees extended horizontally,
clean engineering diagram style, arrows indicating motion between states,
silver aluminum body with dark blue solar cells on panel, white background,
technical animation sequence style, side orthographic view, no text

## Usage Notes

1. **Bing Image Creator** (free): Go to bing.com/images/create and paste the prompt
2. **ChatGPT Plus** ($20/mo): Use DALL-E 3 directly in chat
3. **Midjourney**: Add `--ar 16:9` for widescreen or `--ar 1:1` for square
4. **Leonardo.ai**: Select "Product Photography" or "3D Render" preset

After generating, save images to `final_paper/images/` with names like:
- `figure_a1_stowed.png`
- `figure_a2_deployed.png`
- `figure_a3_exploded.png`
- `figure_a4_shielding.png`
- `figure_a5_deployment.png`

Then update the paper to reference these images instead of ASCII art.
