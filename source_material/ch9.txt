Interference Aspects
9.1 General Interference Aspects
Generally, interference sources are statistically independent.
Interference may be considered as a form of noise. Thus, the interference
at each source may be added directly to give the total interference at
the end user receiver. The eects of interference must be assessed in
terms of: (i) the amount of frequency overlap between the interfering
spectrum and the wanted channel passband of the end user receiver
and (ii) the tolerable disturbing (interference) signal power level to the
end user receiver. There are various sources of interference in a satellite
communication system. These may be broadly classied as intra‐system
and inter‐system.
Intra‐interference can occur when the lters used for isolating adjacent
channels do not have sucient roll‐o characteristic. This interference
is called adjacent channel interference (ACI). Such interference can be
minimized by using adequate guard bands between adjacent channels
and well‐designated lters. A guard band (GB) is the dierence between
the upper edge of the band and the last frequency within a band. However, the use of wide guard bands leads to inecient use of the
channel bandwidth and higher operating cost per carrier. Therefore,
a technical and economic compromise should be made. Whatever the
compromise is chosen, part of the power of a carrier adjacent to a given
carrier will be captured by the receiver tuned to the frequency of the
carrier considered. Quality is maintained if the captured power is under
permitted limits. A link margin of (0.5–1) dB is adequate to compensate
for intra‐system interference (Richharia 1999).

• Satellite transmitter interferes into terrestrial station receiver (1)
• Terrestrial station transmitter interferes into satellite receiver (2)
Intra‐system interference can be caused by coupling of orthogonally
polarized signals in dual polarized system, also. A horizontally polarized
signal can interfere with vertically polarized signal and vice versa.
Rain and ice can cause interference at ground stations because
of depolarization. This can be minimized by using well‐designed
ground station receivers and antennas (typical values of cross‐polar
discrimination in well‐designed antennas are of the order of 25–30 dB)
(Richharia 1999), or especially by applying circular polarization.
Inter‐system interference may occur between a satellite system and
terrestrial system whenever the same frequencies are shared. Certain
frequency bands above 1 GHz are shared between the xed satellite
and xed terrestrial services. Both services are necessary to satisfy the
telecommunication needs of the world, so these services have coexisted
for over four decades and probably will continue to coexist in the future. With so many telecommunications services using radio transmissions,
interference between services can arise in a number of ways. Figure
9.1 shows the possible interference scenarios between satellite and
terrestrial services:

Figure 9.1 Interference scenarios.
• Satellite ground station transmitter interferes into terrestrial station
receiver (3)
• Terrestrial station transmitter interferes into satellite ground station
receiver (4)
The satellite ground stations typically operate at high elevation angles, while terrestrial stations operate at low elevation angles. This simplies
situation allowing spatial discrimination in both direction (3) and (4)
in Figure 9.1. But, for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites there is a
communication under low elevations angles, also, so the interference
eects have to be considered. (The term ground station is specically
associated with satellite circuits and terrestrial station is specically
associated with microwave line of sight circuits.)
Permitted frequency sharing imposes limits on transmission levels
for terrestrial transmitters, ground satellite stations, and satellite
transmitters in certain bands and services, aiming to minimize
intersystem interference. These limitations should be coordinated to
Figure 9.1 Interference scenarios.

regulations limits, we can apply the following means by which can be

• Co‐channel interference
• Out‐of‐band interference
From the technical and practical point of view, two classications of
interference should be considered (Gordon and Morgan 1993). These two
scenarios are presented in Figure 9.2:
The co‐channel interference occurs when the user's receiver is disturbed
by the system or equipment operating at the same frequency as
the user's receiver (Figure 9.2a). More problematic is out‐of‐band
interference. This interference occurs when the intended receiver is hit
by signals that are generated by equipment that does not operate in
the same frequency as that receiver. The phenomenon whereby one
or more new signals are generated is called intermodulation. These
new generated signals (intermodulation products) can unexpectedly fall
within a victim receiver's licensed passband (Figure 9.2b), interfering
with signal reception. These unwanted intermodulation products can
occur in receivers and may coincide with the operating frequency of the
receiver, in which case the wanted signal can be masked. If the signal is
too strong, it will completely block the desired receiving signal (Bulloch
1987; Mendenhall 2001; National Telecommunications and Information
Systems 2006).
9.2 Intermodulation Products
The inuence source of noise in a satellite communication system is the
intermodulation noise generated by nonlinear transfer characteristics
of devices. Toward the uplink, the intermodulation noise is mainly
generated because of the high‐power amplier (HPA) nonlinearity.
Related to downlink performance, especially in urban areas (presence
of wireless networks, xed or mobile) intermodulation should be
considered because of the low noise amplier (LNA) nonlinearity.

to them. Filtering becomes very hard if the intermodulation products
fall inside the passband. These unwanted intermodulation products can
occur in receivers and may coincide with the operating frequency of the
receiver, in which case the wanted signal can be masked. The level of
these products is a function of the power received and the linearity of
the receiver/preamplier. Moreover, the amplitude of the intermodulation
product decreases with the order of the product. Further, out‐of‐
band intermodulation products transmitted from the ground stations
or satellites result in interference to other systems. To minimize
such harmful emissions, radio regulations restrict such out‐of‐band
transmissions from ground stations to very low levels. There is no single
technical method to eliminate the impact of intermodulation products;
on‐site experimental investigations are needed (Mendenhall 2001). Such
approach and experimental results for LEO ground stations will be
further claried later.

9.3 Intermodulation by Uplink Signal at
LEO Satellite Ground Stations
At the ground station located in an urban area with the high penetration
of mobile radio systems, it is not easy to eliminate intermodulation
interference signals since these are unpredictable. There is no single
technical method to eliminate them, so again, on‐site investigations and
experimental measurements are needed.
Ground stations in urban areas should be designed so that, at the receiver
input, the level of the signal received from the satellite via the main beam
of the ground station antenna exceeds the in‐band noise by an adequate
margin. But, the unwanted out‐of‐band inputs, as intermodulation
products, generated by the ground station uplink signal and signals from
nearby mobile system base stations, even though they are received via
sidelobes in the ground station's antenna pattern, they could be higher
and can mask the wanted signal (Maral and Bousquet, 2002; Sklar 2001;
Mendenhall 2001).
Idea: The intention is to mathematically and by executed experiment
conrm whether the intermodulation products will disturb the receiver
at the Vienna satellite ground station dedicated for communication with
MOST satellite.

Method: Math analysis and experimental execution is applied. Figure 9.5
presents the experiment setup that enables us to generally check the
intermodulation disturbance at the any receiving satellite ground station
(Cakaj et al. 2005).
In Figure 9.5 in front of satellite receiving ground station the GSM
1800 signals are presented. The similar procedure could be used in case
of other MW signal presence, also. As in case of intermodulation, each
specic case specically should be studied. Thus, here we analyze further
the intermodulation disturbance at Vienna satellite ground station
within MOST scientic space observation project.
The presence of intermodulation products, at ground station, near the
downlink frequency (f
r = 2232 MHz) caused by GSM 1800 and uplink
signal (f
t = 2055 MHz) is expected because of eventual nonlinearity of the
LNA used in the front end at the downlink of the ground station. By the
nonlinearity of the LNA, the intermodulation products will be generated
from the uplink signal at frequency f
t on one hand and GSM signals
at frequencies fGSM on the other. Only third‐order intermodulation
products will be considered.

9.10. (Cakaj et al. 2005; Cakaj and Malaric 2007).
In the center of Figure 9.10 is the desired signal coming from the satellite. On the left side there are intermodulation products that do not mask the
desired receiving signal. The span in Figure 9.10 is 30 MHz. The receiving
bandwidth from Table 3.1 is 76.8 KHz, so although intermodulation
products are present, they are too far from the receiving bandwidth to
signicantly degrade the signal. The advantage of this case is that the
satellite downlink frequencies lie in a band that is in fact the mirrored
guard band of GSM 1800 MHz in IF domain (Figure 9.8 and Figure 9.9).
358
The envelope around signal f
r at Figure 9.9 stemmed from mathematical
analysis and the envelope of the experimentally recorded signal around
f
r are almost identical, in this case conrming each other. This makes
possible to have LNAs directly connected to the feed without lter, and
therefore the maximum downlink margin.
Conclusion: The nal conclusion is that the presence of the 50 W
uplink signal and the GSM 1800 signals do not produce intermodulation
products that disturb the performance of the downlink receiving system
at the (LEO) satellite ground station. This makes it possible to have LNAs
directly connected to the feed without lter, and therefore the maximal
downlink margin. But, in case of the intermodulation disturbance, the
lter should be implemented in the front end, more exactly in between
the feeder and LNA.
9.4 Modeling of Interference Caused by Uplink
Signal for LEO Satellite Ground Stations
Idea: Interference can negatively aect the functionality of the
satellite ground station. The major source of interference in a
satellite communication system is intermodulation noise generated by
nonlinear transfer characteristics of devices. Toward the uplink, the
intermodulation noise is mainly generated because of HPA nonlinearity.
Related to the downlink performance, especially in urban areas (presence
of mobile and xed wireless networks) intermodulation should be
considered because of LNA nonlinearity. Disturbance introduced due
to nonlinearity is known as intermodulation interference. If spurious
signals generated as intermodulation products behind LNA fall within a
passband of a receiver and the signal level is of sucient amplitude, it can
degrade the receiver's performance.
At the ground stations located in urban areas with high density of mobile
radio systems it is not easy to eliminate intermodulation interference
signals, since these are unpredictable. These new generated signals can

and 2f
t − fx are respectively and (these yields out from
trigonometry) where Ax
is amplitude of any radio signal of frequency fx
unexpectedly fall within a victim receiver licensed passband. In case the
generated intermodulation signal is too strong, it will not only interfere
but could completely block the desired receiving signal. Filtering
becomes very hard if the intermodulation products fall inside the
passband. So, the receiver's operation will be disturbed if two conditions
are fullled: (i) interference signal fall within a passband; and (ii) has too
high power.
Based on this concept and the example described under Section 9.3, the
idea is to build the intermodulation interference modeling owchart that
enables the interference calculation caused by any other radio source of
frequency fx and the satellite uplink signal of frequency f
t
. From the
appropriate model will be built the interference calculator to determine
and predict such disturbances of the receiver, based on the radio signals
environmental presence.
Method: Based on interference concepts and the previously
mathematical interpretation, considering radiofrequency signal (fx
)
present in the front end of the satellite ground station's receiving
system, which is potential for generating intermodulation interference,
it is analyzed and then modeled the intermodulation interference, and
further is introduced the intermodulation interference calculator.
Only third‐order intermodulation products are considered. Among third‐
order intermodulation products are considered only components of
frequencies 2fx − f
t and 2f
t − fx
. Analyses under Section 9.2 conrmed

uplink satellite signal of frequency f

. Thus, third‐order
intermodulation products are characterized by:
(9.5)
(9.6)
Usually, the amplitude Ax
is low in front of LNA since it is limited by
ITU rules about radiated power and consequently it is expected that the
amplitude will not disturb the receiver. The most dangerous
component is since the amplitude At
is high because this is
the amplitude of uplink signal that must overcome too‐high attenuation
toward the satellite.

is intermodulation interference frequency of amplitude Nin
for
n = 1, 2 behind the LNA. Since, the analyses are related mainly to the
frequency domain, in order to simplify the situation, it is assumed that
there is no amplication on overall system chain.
The reference checking point is downconverter's IF output or receiver's
IF input. So, the intermodulation interference is checked around
intermediate frequency f

achieved by local oscillator frequency of fLO

will have:
Thus, if intermodulation frequency fullls the Eq. (9.10) or Eq. (9.11)
the desired signal at the receiver could be masked by intermodulation
interference.
The next step is considering power (amplitude) issue. Thus, the level of
interfering signal should be compared with the level of desired signal
at IF input. For comparison of these levels, it is sucient to consider
the relationship between the two relative levels (one of them is the
reference level). Usually this is measured with a spectrum analyzer
at IF checkpoint. The criteria for amplitudes comparison between
the desired and interference signal depends on the Earth's station
size and dedication. The criteria between downlink carrier level and
interference signal level range from 20 to 30 dB (http://www.satsig.net/

where S(IF) is desired signal power and Nin(IF) intermodulation

conclusion is that there is no downlink disturbance by intermodulation

analyses are of high importance on the nal decision of the ground

modeling approach.
9.5 Downlink Adjacent Interference for LEO Satellites
The downlink adjacent interference is expected when two satellites
operate in close proximity to each other and share the same frequency,
aecting the desired signal‐to‐noise ratio of the downlink. Further, this
problem is considered and analyzed under very practical operational
circumstances for SARSAT (Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking)
system (constellation). The SARSAT system is operated and managed by
NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).
The SARSAT system is designed to provide distress alert and location
data to assist on search and rescue operations. SARSAT locates distress
beacons (406 MHz) activated at distress locations. The system calculates
a location of the distress event using Doppler processing techniques.
Processed data are continuously retransmitted through the SARSAT
downlink to local user terminals (LUT) when satellites are in view.
The downlink communication, from SARSAT satellites to LUTs, will be
further treated from the interference point of view.
Receive‐only ground stations, specically designed to track the search
and rescue satellites as they pass across the sky are called LUTs. The
communication link is established when the satellite ies within a LUT's
visibility. This “y‐over” is called a satellite pass. The distress beacon
signal is received on the satellite uplink from the distress location and
then it is transmitted to LUTs by downlink. Normally, the beacon location
is random and LUT locations are xed and known. The LUTs are fully
automated and completely unmanned at all times [Losik 1995; Landis
and Mulldolland 1993]. Communication from satellite operates in two
366
modes (Repeater mode and store and forward mode, Figures 8.4, 8.5,
Chapter 8) transmitting in LHCP (left‐hand circular polarization) to any
LUT in its view (COSPAS –SARSAT System Monitoring and Reporting
2008).
The LEOLUT (means LUT dedicated for LEOs), usually includes a satellite
receive antenna, a digital processing system, and the software for control, monitoring and processing functions. When a satellite receives a beacon
signal from a distress location, the Search and Rescue Processor (SARP)
on board the LEO satellite performs Doppler processing and generates an
entry into the 2.4 kb/s processed data stream (pds) that is continuously
“dumped” to any LEOLUT in view of the satellite's downlink footprint.
(COSPAS –SARSAT System Monitoring and Reporting 2008).
LEOLUT software accepts the satellite's downlink data stream, then
decodes and extracts beacon data messages. From each satellite pass
taken by the LEOLUT, software selects data from each detected beacon
and validates time, frequency (Doppler shifted frequency), and message
content. Data from each pass, and for each beacon identication
number, is then passed to the solution processing software. The solution
processing software determines an optimum location based on a Doppler
frequency curve, built based on frequency shift. An example of recorded
Doppler curve at LUT is given in Figure 9.13.
This is an excellent Doppler curve providing 15 Doppler events, noted
from 1 to 15. Time is given on the x‐axis and Doppler frequency shift
on the y‐axis. Using the orbital parameters of the satellite, the beacon
frequency, and the known Doppler shift, the distance of the beacon
relative to the projection of the satellite orbit ground‐track on the Earth
can be determined as is depicted in Figure 8.10 (Vataralo et al. 1995; Cakaj
et al. 2010a).
Communication reliability during a satellite pass may be degraded when
satellites sharing the same downlink frequency are adjacent to each
other. The downlinks of all SARSAT LEO satellites use the same 1544.5
367
Figure 9.13 Doppler curve.
MHz frequency (COSPAS – SARSAT 406 MHz Frequency Management Plan,
2008). In cases where the satellites are within the main lobe of the
local user terminal antenna, transmissions from adjacent satellites act as
interference to one another, consequently degrading the desired signal at
the appropriate LUT (Vataralo et al. 1995; Cakaj and Malaric 2007). This
can result in missed distress beacon bursts or no stored solutions received
at the LUT, consequently no data is provided about a distress location.
This should be avoided as much as possible!
Analysis on interference prediction, interference periods, and mitigating
procedure are further discussed. Interference mitigation of signicant
duration, with attached measurement results, is also presented. For
further analytical purposes, to avoid repetition, we use the data from
Table 8.1 and Table 8.2, which present the space and ground segment of
the SARSAT system.

9.6 Adjacent Satellites Interference
(Identification/Avoiding)
Satellites are considered as adjacent if they are too close to each other
determined by their space orbital parameters, or too close in radar map or
as the ground tracks, which for further analysis is applied. The adjacent
satellite interference manifests when two adjacent satellites share the
same downlink frequency, and are seen too close to each other from
the ground station. If the transmitted EIRP (equivalent isotropic radiated
power) from each satellite is similar, for two satellites close to each other,
the two signals will act as interference to each other, severely degrading
the received desired signal (Kanellopoulos et al. 2007; Cakaj et al. 2010a).
The above is illustrated in Figure 9.14 where the receiving ground
stations noted as AK, CA, and HI(as a part of SARSAT ground segment) are
looking at two satellites S9 and S11(a part of SARSAT space segment).
The downlink of all SARSAT LEO satellites uses the same 1544.5 MHz
frequency, and in principle the same transmitted EIRP from each satellite.
Thus, if two satellites are too close to each other, their signals will
interfere with each other, severely degrading the received signal (COSPAS
– SARSAT 406 MHz Frequency Management Plan, 2008). The received
carrier frequency provides a useful measure of the interference level.
The carrier frequency of the transmitter is 1544.5 MHz, but the relative
velocity between the satellite and LUT causes a Doppler shift in the
received frequency, and a plot over time shows the characteristic Doppler
curve of a LEO satellite. As the orbital positions of the two satellites
converge, so do their relative velocities to the LUT and Doppler curves
(COSPAS –SARSAT System Monitoring and Reporting 2008).
Slight dierences in relative velocity between the two interfering
satellites cause two distinct curves of carrier frequency. When the
dierence in relative velocity and angular separation is minimal, the
Doppler curves of the carrier frequency become almost identical. Figure

When the receiver locks on the interfering signal, jumping (interruptions
on curve) of the received carrier frequency is seen. These interruptions
in carrier lock result in loss of downlink capability and can visually show
when interference has occurred. Figure 9.15 shows that for most of the
pass, each LUT is successfully locked on its desired signal. Two vertical
lines, in Figure 9.15 show the time interval of interference. This can
result in missed bursts (missed Doppler event), or no signal received at all.

For SARSAT system, the downlink interference between S11 and S9
(Figure 9.15) was documented by France in March and April 2009, when
S9 and S11 were close to each other. The March 8, 2009, occurrence
of interference between these two satellites caused four passes, over
a period of three orbits, which produced no pds solutions. The April
16, 2009, occurrence of interference caused three passes with no pds
solutions over a period of three orbits, presented in Table 9.3 (DOY means
day of the year). But, the number of no pds solutions alone cannot
accurately gauge the amount of interference in the downlink. It is a
signicant variability in the number pds bursts received by the satellite
during each orbit depending on the path.
Considering orbital parameters (Table 8.1), three pairs of operational
SARSAT satellites are susceptible to this interference condition: S10/
S12, S9/S11, and S7/S8 identied and presented in Table 9.4 with their
respective orbital periods and dierences between them, and recorder by
NOAA orbital software are given in Figure 9.16.
The small dierence in orbital periods of the S10/S12 pair is particularly
concerning. The Orbit repeat cycle indicates the number of orbits that
satellite should pass through to achieve the same position relative to the
adjacent satellite and to the xed ground station. Mathematically, Orbit
repeat cycle is the ratio of orbit period and orbital dierence. Further, for
this cycle to be expressed in days, it should be divided by the mean motion
from Table 8.1 (for example for S12 is 14.1095). The SARSAT documented
that the launch of S12 (NOAA‐19) into an orbital plane similar to

9.6.1 Adjacent Interference Identification and Duration Interval
To determine the duration of the interference periods, one must nd the
minimal angular separation between satellites as seen from the ground
station, when interference occurs. This is highly dependent on the gain
pattern and pointing accuracy of the LUT antenna. For a typical LEOLUT
antenna gain pattern, the −3 dB (half power) beamwidth is found to be
±4.25°. This beamwidth represents the necessary angular separation to
prevent undesired signals from being highly amplied. As the angular
separation increases, the gain of the interfering source decreases. Since
the distance between the two satellites is relatively constant during a

9.6.1 Adjacent Interference Identification and Duration Interval
To determine the duration of the interference periods, one must nd the
minimal angular separation between satellites as seen from the ground
station, when interference occurs. This is highly dependent on the gain
pattern and pointing accuracy of the LUT antenna. For a typical LEOLUT
antenna gain pattern, the −3 dB (half power) beamwidth is found to be
±4.25°. This beamwidth represents the necessary angular separation to
prevent undesired signals from being highly amplied. As the angular
separation increases, the gain of the interfering source decreases. Since
the distance between the two satellites is relatively constant during a
374
(9.14)
singular pass, it can be seen that the apparent angular separation is
greatest when the satellites are at their maximum elevation (closest
approach) (Cakaj et al. 2010a). Thus, minimum angular separation occurs
when the satellites are at minimum elevation. Thus, the cases with low
elevation are of interest from the interference aspect.
Idea: Under the case that the satellites based on their orbital parameters
are adjacent, and the interference is expected, the main question is to
conclude how long it will take? Further elaborated!
Method: Mathematical and simulation approach are applied and
conrming each other. Let us consider a LUT with antenna aperture
of ±4.25°. This antenna is tracking a satellite, which is moving ahead
relative to another satellite which is seen at minimum elevation above
the horizon (5°), as shown in Figure 9.17.
These adjacent satellites, seen at low elevation and with a very low
separation angle, have great potential to interfere with each other. The
slant range is calculated for elevations of 9.25° and 5° (5° is designed
horizon with 4.25° separation) from the ground station. Spatially the
separation angle is the spherical angle from 0° to 4.25°. The 0° point
is on the desired satellite, and 4.25° point is the –3 dB interference
point; consequently, it is the largest possible distance for interference
from another satellite. The general formula for the slant range (d) under
elevation ε0
is (Cakaj and Malaric 2007):

of possible interference. Considering that these satellites are always
moving with a particular velocity v, the question is how long they can be
together within a separation angle of 4.25° or lower!
Results: Finally, the math results for separation distances between
adjacent satellites and interference repeat cycle are given in Tables 9.5
and 9.6.
In Table 9.6, the Duration represents expected time interval of possible
adjacent interference. (This is needed time for satellite S12(S10) moving
at velocity of 7.423km/s to pass the critical separation distance of
377
416.4km). The frequency of these events and their duration relative to
the xed ground stations depend on the dierence of orbital period times
(Table 9.4). The ratio of interference time duration to time dierence in
orbital periods represents Interference repeat cycle per orbit. For duration
of 56.3s divided by orbital time dierence of 1.3s from Table 9.4 the
repeat cycle is 43.3. This cycle is expressed in days when divided by mean
motion (Table 8.1, it is 14.1095). Thus, for repeat cycle of 43.3 divided
by 14.1095 stems the value of approx. 3.10 days. Considering separation
distance, predictions for the interference repeat cycle of satellite pairs are
listed in Table 9.6. Math results from Table 9.6 are in full accordance with
outputs from orbital software given in Table 9.4.
Conclusion: In general, the dierence in orbital periods between the
two satellites will dictate the duration and repeatability of interference
intervals. From Table 9.6 it is obvious that the S10/S12 pair experiences
the highest interference repeat cycle – consequently, the longest possible
interference disturbance, because of too‐close orbital periods. This
means that the satellite pair S10/S12 is of particular concern from
the interference aspect. The S7/S8 pair is the least experiences with
interference (obvious from Figure 9.16).

9.7 Modulation Index Application for
Downlink Interference Identification
On support of interference identication, LEOLUT's software uses two
more parameters: modulation index (mean) and modulation index (root
mean square – RMS). Modulation index indicates the quantity by which
the modulated variable varies around its unmodulated level (Cakaj 2012).
Considering downlink phase modulation, modulation index (mean)
relates to the variations in the phase of the carrier signal, expressed as:
∆θ(t) is the phase deviation.

of 56.3s divided by orbital time dierence of 1.3s from Table 9.4 the

distance, predictions for the interference repeat cycle of satellite pairs are
listed in Table 9.6. Math results from Table 9.6 are in full accordance with

mathematics, the root mean square (RMS) is a statistical measure of the
magnitude of varying quantity. It is especially useful for sinusoids wave
forms. In case of set of n values mi1

For illustration and interpretation, two dierent Doppler curves are
given, with no interference and the next one with interference presence,
presented in Figures 9.18 and 9.19, respectively.
The received carrier frequency is shown on the left axis, and modulation
index mean and RMS (route mean square) on the right axis. Modulation
index indicates the quantity by how much the modulated variable varies
around its unmodulated level. Considering downlink phase modulation,
this index relates to the variations in the phase of the carrier signal.
In Figure 9.18, there is no interference, so the lines expressing
modulation index and root mean square index are almost at, conrming
noninterference presence. Figure 9.19, is the case with medium maximal
elevation of 36°. Figure 9.19 shows the interference during AOS
(acquisition of satellite- left circled part). Further, as the satellite moves
toward higher elevation there is no interference (medium part of gure)
and then again there is interference near LOS (loss of satellite- right
circled part). Frequency jumps in the downlink carrier can be seen in the
lower‐right corner of Figure 9.19, manifested by a high mean modulation
index at the same time. In Figure 9.19, it is very expressive modulation

As another approach, and for results comparison, a satellite orbit analysis
program (at NSOF, SARSAT, NOAA) using the known LUT antenna gain
pattern is applied. Again, when the both satellites are within –3 dB
beamwidth (separation angle of 4.25°) from the point of view of the
LUT, it was determined that interference is possible. Considering events
from Table 9.3, a period from May to December is then conducted. The
beginning of the period of possible interference was designated as the
rst pass at a SARSAT LUT where S10 and S12 would be within 4.25°
of each other, at any point during the pass. The predicted periods of
interference were generated by a NOAA orbital analysis software. Table

Figure 9.20 Doppler curve for Maximal elevation of 9°.
The appropriate software conrmed that the duration of the S10/S12
interference is of particular concern, and has been veried through this
simulation method to be about three days. This proves the accordance
between mathematical analysis results (Table 9.6) and simulation results
given in Table 9.7 (Cakaj et al. 2010a). The duration of S9/S11 interference
periods decreases. Periods of S8/S7 interference are negligible and
therefore are not listed.
Through these two approaches, we can conrm that considering antenna
pattern and satellite pass geometry, analytical models can be built to
predict the time and duration of interference based on the angular
separation between the two satellites (Cakaj et al. 2010a).
If operational impacts become severe, eorts must be performed to
mitigate interference, specically under low elevation. Figure 9.20 shows

Canadian team within a COSPAS‐SARSAT system developed a procedure
to interrupt RF transmission from the satellite with a minimal chance of
irrecoverable failure. The NOAA‐SARSAT executed this procedure when
the operational impacts of interference became evident. The NOAA‐
SARSAT analyzed the downlink characteristics during the periods both
before and after the mitigation actions were taken. This process is further
described.
Satellite pair S10/S12, as the worst case of adjacent interference is
further analyzed. The Canadian procedure to interrupt the downlink RF
transmission from the satellite is considered to be applied as a method
to mitigate adjacent satellite interference. The turno transmission was
planned for S10. The situation before turning o the planned S10 satellite
is given in Figure 9.21 under Max‐El of 12°, where the interference
presence shows up!
In Figure 9.21 before the turno of the S10 downlink, the received carrier
frequency can be seen jumping from one satellite's downlink to the other
one, causing the degradation of downlink capabilities. The modulation
indices are higher during these times since the receiver cannot lock on
only one carrier. Figure 9.22 shows the same plot after the downlink
of S10 had been turned o. They show that the only increase of the
modulation indices occurs near the LOS, when the signal is the weakest.
Figure 9.22 is typical of what would be seen during a nominal pass with
no interference. The procedures developed by Canada and executed by
the USA were successful in interference mitigation (Cakaj et al. 2010a).

these interference periods, signicant degradation of downlink occurs.

The procedure to interrupt the downlink RF transmission from the
“undesired” satellite is applied as a method to mitigate adjacent satellite
385
interference. For newly built terminals though, larger antennas with a
narrower beamwidth may also reduce the adjacent interference issue and
impacts.
The DASS (Distress Alert Satellite System) is a newly developed &
future approach intended to enhance the international COSPAS‐SARSAT
program. In this eort the satellite‐aided search and rescue (SAR) system
will install 406 MHz SAR instruments on the MEO navigational satellites
[GPS (US), Galileo (EU), and Glonass (Russian Federation)]. With an
expected 80 satellites once fully operational, new processing algorithms
and interference mitigation strategies should also be considered. Because
of the much higher altitudes of MEO satellites, a larger separation
distance exists, and the adjacent interference will be less pronounced.
9.8 Uplink Interference Identification for
LEO Search and Rescue Satellites
For a rescue operation to be successful, it is crucial that the distress
location be rapidly determined. The location determination is based on
Doppler frequency shift, and its accuracy depends on the signal quality
received at the satellite from the distress beacon. The distress beacon
signal can be disturbed by interferers, which degrade the performance
of the on‐board 406 MHz Search and Rescue Processor (SARP) and reduce
the probability of detecting real beacon messages (COSPAS –SARSAT
System Monitoring and Reporting 2008). Emergency distress beacons
are essentially specialized radio transmitters for search and rescue
purposes carried by airplanes, ships, and individuals. SAR (search and
rescue) satellites can even “hear” faint distress signals from beacons.
The beacon can be activated manually or automatically. Since February
2009, rescue beacons have transmitted on 406 MHz. Some characteristics
of 406 MHz beacons are shown in Table 9.8 (Specication for COSPAS –
SARSAT406MHz Distress Beacons 2008).
386
Table 9.8 Some of beacon characteristics.
Output power 5 W
Transmission Burst (500 ms on every 50 sec)
Modulation Phase
Frequency stability High
The 406.0–406.1 MHz band has been allocated by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) for distress alerting using low‐
power, emergency radio beacons. This 100 KHz licensed band is
organized in channels for multiuser random access at the satellite.
Frequency spectrum lies in the band 406.0–406.1 MHz. These radio
beacons emit stable, constant frequency, which is highly important for
location determination. The 406 MHz carrier is phase modulated with
information such as beacon identication, synchronization frame, and
the nature of emergency. From the time slot of 500 ms, only 160 ms
are dedicated for poor carrier and the rest is for modulated data, such
are beacon type, its country of origin and the registration number of
the maritime vessel, aircraft, or individual (Specication for COSPAS –
SARSAT406MHz Distress Beacons 2008).
Idea: If the beacon signal at the distress location to be sent through
the uplink to the satellite is disturbed, the satellite's receiver will not
be able to receive the appropriate accurate (clean) beacon signal, and
consequently will not yield the right Doppler curve to provide the
correct rescue location. The question is to identify the impact of uplink
interference on Doppler curve, and consequently on distress location
determination (Cakaj et al. 2010b).
Method: For conrmation of the above discussed eect, the records
are taken from NSOF (NOAA Satellite Operation Facility), where the
author did his research (NSOF 2010; National Telecommunications and
Information Systems 2006).
387
Active signal sources in various areas of the world can produce spurious
emissions in the 406 MHz allocated range, interfering with the NOAA‐
SARSAT system, whether or not they operate at the 406 MHz band. How severe the interference is will depend on the amount of frequency
overlap between the interfering spectrums and the allocated channel
passband, relative to the tolerable level of the receiver. NOAA‐SARSAT
satellites have 406 MHz repeaters for retransmitting emissions received
from Earth in the band 406.0–406.1 MHz. As a result, the time/frequency
pairs of interference emissions can be measured with specially designed
LEOLUTs, which monitor 406 MHz interference using specic software
in the LEOLUTs in conjunction with a 406 MHZ SAR processor. The
software at the LEOLUT utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to
determine time, frequency, and the power of the interfering signal.
Results: Two spectrograms are further given, extracted by the
examination of the Doppler frequency shift of data transmissions from
detected beacons or interfering transmitters (NSOF 2010; USTTI, Course
M6‐102, National Telecommunications and Information Systems 2006;
Cakaj et al. 2010b).
Figure 9.23 shows the spectrogram view with no interference. The
Doppler curve is related to beacon A. The number of data points (Doppler
events) depends on communication duration between a satellite and
LEOLUT. Satellite orbital parameters, the duration, and, consequently,
the expected data points are known in advance. In Figure 9.23, Doppler
points are discrete, since the beacon hits the satellite in intervals of 50s.
From Figure 9.23, it is obvious a good Doppler curve was provided during
the satellite pass and the distress location was obtained.
Figure 9.24 shows the spectrogram view when interference is present.
Two beacons, B and C, are disturbed by interference. For beacon B, nine
data points were expected and for beacon C, seven data points were
expected. This indicates a medium duration of communication between
a satellite and a LEOLUT. The interfering signal is shown in Figure 9.24.
388
Figure 9.23 No interference spectrogram view.
The interfering signal is continuous for a long period of time as compared
to the periodic 500 ms beacon bursts. The continuous interfering signals
may produce a Doppler curve, but no identication code can be extracted
from an interfering signal since its modulation, if any, would not be
in the correct format. The lack of identication code is an interference
indicator. Interference caused insucient data points to be captured for
a Doppler curve, and, consequently, no distress location for these two
beacons was obtained.

Conclusion: NOAA‐SARSAT is a data communication system dedicated
for search and rescue purposes, oriented on determination of distress
locations worldwide. Since uplink interference can disturb the satellite's
receiver, blocking the location of the distress location, thus a very
sophisticated method has been developed and applied at LEOLUTs to
identify uplink interference, providing spectrograms above applied. This
method provides data about frequency, power, and time of interference.

for search and rescue purposes, oriented on determination of distress
locations worldwide. Since uplink interference can disturb the satellite's
receiver, blocking the location of the distress location, thus a very
sophisticated method has been developed and applied at LEOLUTs to
identify uplink interference, providing spectrograms above applied. This
method provides data about frequency, power, and time of interference.
